# FXDemo
**The Task**
The goal of this assignment is to allow you to demonstrate your programming skills
and to help us understand your approach when developing a mobile application.

We would like you to implement a tab bar application that displays FX related articles
and market information.

- First tab should be a master/details to load a list of articles and presents the
    details of the article on selection. API -
    https://content.dailyfx.com/api/v1/dashboard
- Second tab should load a list of markets: API -
    https://content.dailyfx.com/api/v1/markets

Please use the specified endpoints to fetch the data for each tab.

Do not spend more than four hours on the assignment.

**Requirements**

- Please use the latest stable Xcode + Swift
- Deployment target is iOS 13+
- Avoid use of any third-party libraries. We would prefer to see a vanilla approach
    so we can see you understand the underlying concepts. We are open to using
    third party libraries at IG, but for the purposes of this test, please avoid doing so.
- Please ensure your app includes tests

**What we are looking for:**

- Elegance, simplicity and maintainability of your code.
- Code consistency. Please refer to a community-maintained style guide if you are
    not sure (eg: Github: https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide, Ray
    Wenderlich: https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).
- A clear architecture, separate of concerns and adherence to iOS design patterns
- Knowledge of the iOS human interface guidelines
- Appropriate application of relevant native iOS frameworks (Foundation, UIKit)
- Good code coverage with unit tests
